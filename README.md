Creating a Cloud SQL instance in Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) features distinct processes and user experiences. In GCP, users can easily navigate the Cloud SQL section to select a database engine and configure instance settings, focusing on simplicity and straightforwardness. In contrast, Azureâ€™s setup requires navigating the Azure Portal and offers a broader range of configuration options, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. While GCP emphasizes user-friendliness and has a more transparent pricing model, Azure provides extensive functionalities that cater to experienced users but may involve a steeper learning curve. Both platforms include integrated monitoring tools, but the accessibility and navigation can differ significantly.
