Working with Managed Databases in Azure and GCP

## 1. Start and Configure a Managed Database

- Azure MySQL
  - Navigate to the Azure Portal and create an azure database for MySQL
  - Configure the database with basic settings (e.g., compute and storage options)
  - Start the database service and note the connection details

- GCP MySQL
  - acess the Google cloud console and create a cloud SQL instance with MySQL
  - configure the database instance similarly, noting any differences in setup between Azure and GCP.
  - Start the database service and document the connection details
 
## 2. Explore BigQuery (GCP) 
- BigQuery
  - In GCP, navigate to BigQuery and create a database.
  - Load a small sample data file into a table within the dataset (e.g., a CSV file)
  - Run a simple query against the dataset to retrieve specific data.
  - Monitor the usage and cost associated with running the query.
 
## 3. Monitor Database Services 
- Azure
  - Use the Azure portal to monitor the performance and cost of the MySQL database. Explore metrics like CPu usage, memory, and query performance.
 
- GCP
  - Use the GCP console to monitor the Cloud SQL instance and the BigQuery dataset. Pay attention to similar metrics and note any differences in monitoring tools between the two platforms.
